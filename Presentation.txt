Rohin : Hi , my name is Rohin and I am here to tell you a sad story.


3 days back, I was  booking  a flight through Make My trip.
**Taking out my Phone*** 

I am at the payment gateway and I don't know how my internet connection had some issue after i entered my OTP.
I reloaded the page and payment was finally successful.
I later realised that my money had deducted twice. I need my money back , I wrote a mail which looks like : 
 
 *** Shows the mail(which we took as input ) on screen ******************
 I haven't got a reply back till now , I wonder what is wrong with my Bank.
 
 
 Khanooja comes in : 
 Khanooja : We all have faced a similar issue like this before , but let's look at how we propose a solution to it.
 As soon as we receive a mail , we assign a dispute id lets say d001 to the customer naming say Rohin ,( Shows THE dashboard screen for Rohin with dispute id d001).
 Our basic aim is to first classify this dispute and recognize what exactly the problem is without any human reading the email.
 We do that by probabilitistic classification of the dispute. We have first trained our model with some cases such as DuplicateTransaction, Fradulent Transaction, Forgot pin,
 Chargeback etc.  Our model has been trained to identify some keywords and can map it to different cases.
 So , whenever a new email comes , our model analyses it, assigns a dispute id based to the customer's email-id & acct number , and bases on probabilitistic classification,
 it assigns highest two cases with probability and their resolution.
 Explain this specific case of duplicate transaction and show both the transaction screen & dashboard and explain how resolution time decreases.
 something like this : 
  Here you can see the dashboard which would be visible to our customer care representative. She can see all the open disputes for the customer,
 say d001 & d002. When we click on d001 , by our model we classify the this dispute based on probability , the highest probability being DuplicateTransaction.
 Without minimum manual intervention , without even reading the email , we have classified the problem correctly & can go towards a resolution.

 Similarly , we do for other 2 customers ,
  
  Rohin : explains sarthak's issue of forget pin & how we solve it .
  
  Rohin : Explains the issue for mark's case.
